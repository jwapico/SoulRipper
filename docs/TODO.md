TODO's (~ roughly in order of importance):
  - REFACTOR DOWNLOADING FUNCTIONS (in progress)
      - we should populate the database with TrackData from spotify first, then download Null filepath entries after
  - REFACTOR DATABASE CODE
      - only call sql_session.commit() after a meaningful unit of work - atomicity
      - we should also be wrapping ALL database operations in a try-except block, and calling sql_session.rollback() if we catch an exception
      - we should prolly also remove the UserInfo table and stop storing api keys in the database lol
      - make BaseRepository class that all other repository classes inherit from
          - database interaction event for better cli updates
  - better search and selection for soulseek AND yt-dlp given song title and artist
  - better USER INTERFACE - GUI 
      - we should keep a cli but make it better, the long flags are annoying as fuck
          - maybe reimplement the infinite prompting thing from the submission
      - we should have a way for the user to verify that each downloaded track is correct
          - show them the target track (spotify data), and what was actually downloaded, filepath, metadata, etc
          - allow them to change metadata fields
          - walk them through each downloaded track in their library one by one
          - once they verify the track, we change the filename to be {title} - {artists} rather than however it was downloaded
              - write the original filename in the comments field of the database AND file metadata
      - basically just redesign spotify lmao - i want to be able to manipulate playlists and what not
          - im pretty sure we have read write permissions for playlists
          - better shuffle (can have multiple different options)
          - more ways to sort
          - more options for columns & data shown in playlist/album view
          - tagging system
          - theres also a way to stream songs directly from spotify??? 
              - https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-playback-sdk
          - if we are including a player (we should) we could record statistics (better than spotify)
          - we could go very crazy with this
              - could embed/display wikipedia data to make the experience educational ts
                  - basically just include the sidebar on wikipedia that displays basic facts about the artist/album
                  - https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/
                  - https://pypi.org/project/Wikipedia-API/ 
              - weird idea for playlists: more than one song can follow another
                  - basically playlists are trees now :o
                  - ui would prolly be nested drop downs
      - FLUTTER !!!
          - we need to write a REST API wrapper for our core functionality
          - https://docs.flutter.dev/
          - https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab
          - https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/linux/web
          - music player: https://pub.dev/packages/just_audio
          - we should make sure we have the back end right before we start on the front end
          - look at these for gui and perhaps source code inspo https://github.com/topics/flutter-music-player
  - cache spotify api data so we dont have to retreive ALL of it every time
      - talk to colton eoghan and other potential users about high level design
      - we also need to rewrite the SpotifyClient class to use an async library [async-spotify](https://pypi.org/project/async-spotify/) or write our own library with [aiohttp](https://pypi.org/project/aiohttp/)
  - CONCURRENT DOWNLOADS (tens or hundreds if possible)
      - i think slskd can parallelize downloads, but it may be easier to use asyncio.create_task
      - might get rate limited per soulseek account, could automate the creation of accounts and spin up multiple instances of slskd if necessary
      - unfortunately the slskd-api python wrapper uses requests under the hood, so we need to manually refactor their code to use httpx.AsyncClient for peak concurrency
        - fortunately their code is super easy to read and convert
        - tbh we should just convert the apis we need, plop them in our codebase, and abandon slskd-api completely for peak maintainability
  - pass through ssh keys in docker so git works in vscode
  - write an actual README.md
  - better syncing with local music directory
      - get a songs metadata using an api such as:
          - https://www.discogs.com/developers/
          - big list here: https://soundcharts.com/blog/music-data-api
  - error handling in download functions and probably other places
      - we can write error logging to the comment field of a track
          - we should prollt create a seperate column for this
  - virtualdj xml playlist integration (i already have code for this from a previous project i tihnk)
  - youtube playlist functionality
      - https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/playlists/list
  - type annotations for ALL functions args and return values
  - cleanup comments & add more

  - refactor app params to be global, read only, shared state
